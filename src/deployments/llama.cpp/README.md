Llama.cpp is a production-ready, open-source runner for various [Large Language Models](/general-concepts/large-language-model). 

It has an excellent built-in [server](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/tree/master/examples/server) with HTTP API. 

In this handbook, we will use [Continuous Batching](/general-concepts/continuous-batching), which in practice allows handling parallel requests.
